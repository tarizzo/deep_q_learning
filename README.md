# RBE 595 Term Project: Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Methods Using Deep Q-Learning

This work demonstrates and compares the performance of 
three methods of training a deep reinforcement
learning model; traditional reinforcement learning, transfer
learning, and imitation learning. These methods will be used
to train a Deep Q-learning model to act as an agent in the
Super Mario World video game. The implemented models will
be evaluated based on their final model performance, initial
performance, and time to converge.
